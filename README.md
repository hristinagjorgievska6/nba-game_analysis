# nba-game_analysis
This project analyzes NBA game data from the 2010 and 2014 seasons using Python. It compares scoring between teams, examines how home court advantage affects game outcomes and explores the relationship between win forecasts and point differentials. Visualizations include histograms, boxplots, contingency tables and scatter plots.
